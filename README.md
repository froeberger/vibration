This has been 30 years in development, and remains forever my sole creation.  Here is a verifiable musical note to color correspondance system, and much, much, more.  Use this to determine a person's natural vibratory note.  This is essentially a spiritual / vibrational tool.



All of this is released to you, and to anyone, under a 'free NOT fee', open source license of my own creation which legally stipulates that any and all are free to consume, copy, distribute, download, and enjoy so long as:

      1. I am accredited with the sole authorship and ownership IN PERPETUITY, AD INFINITUM.  This README.md MUST always accompany the Microsoft Word document detailing my system.  This README.md MUST REMAIN UNALTERED.
      
      2. No money is exchanged in connection to the use of my system.  One may not commercialize the data, process, nor use it for financial profit, nor sell it, nor profit in any way by it or from it.  Financial loss caused by the use, distribution, etc. of my system is, however, not only acceptable, but perhaps even desirable and honorable...   ;-)
  
      3.  NOTHING IN MY SYSTEM IS MODIFIED, ALTERED, APPENDED, NOR REMOVED. 
      
      
  
Enjoy!
